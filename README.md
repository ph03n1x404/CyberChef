Official  page https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef
CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser.

How it works
There are four main areas in CyberChef:

The input box in the top right, where you can paste, type or drag the text or file you want to operate on.
The output box in the bottom right, where the outcome of your processing will be displayed.
The operations list on the far left, where you can find all the operations that CyberChef is capable of in categorised lists, or by searching.
The recipe area in the middle, where you can drag the operations that you want to use and specify arguments and options.
